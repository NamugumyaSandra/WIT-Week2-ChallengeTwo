### Arrays, Strings and loops

The function takes a string and returns an array of length 2 containing a new string made of all vowels from the original string and the number of duplicates in the original string. Only the first instance of the vowel is considered.

```
For example:
countVowels(‘dahdah’)  # will return [‘a’, 3]
countVowels(‘drink water’) # will return [‘iae’, 1]
```

### Arrays, conditional logic

The **fizzBuzz** function in `fizzbuzz.js` takes two(2) arrays  and returns Fizz if the combined length of the lists is divisible by 3,  Buzz if it is divisible by 5, Fizzbuzz if it is divisible by both 5 and 3  or the combined length of the list.

```
For example:
fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [ ])    # will return “fizz”
fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [1, 2])  # will return “buzz”  
fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [1]) # will return 4
```

### Test the functions

In the terminal(command prompt) and run the following commands

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn test`
